# SNS-EXT: Seq-N-Slide Extended for Minerva HPC

![Minerva Logo](assets/minerva-logo-ver2.png)

A specialized adaptation of the Seq-N-Slide (SNS) pipeline optimized for Mount Sinai's Minerva High Performance Computing (HPC) environment with LSF job scheduling.

## Overview

SNS-EXT provides automated workflows for common Illumina sequencing-based protocols, including:

- **RNA-seq**: Differential gene expression analysis
- **ChIP-seq**: Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
- **ATAC-seq**: Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin
- **WGBS/RRBS**: Whole genome and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing
- **WES/WGS**: Whole exome/genome variant detection
- **Species identification**: Contaminant screening and quality control

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Minerva-optimized**: Configured for LSF job scheduler and Minerva-specific resources
- ‚úÖ **Modular design**: Individual segments for flexible workflow construction
- ‚úÖ **Quality control**: Comprehensive QC metrics and reporting
- ‚úÖ **Standardized outputs**: Consistent file formats and directory structures
- ‚úÖ **Resource management**: Optimized memory and CPU allocation for HPC environment

## Prerequisites

This pipeline requires **Pixi** for dependency management and environment isolation. Pixi provides reproducible, cross-platform package management using conda-forge packages.

### Install Pixi

Visit the [official Pixi website](https://pixi.sh) for detailed installation instructions, or use the quick install:

```bash
# Quick install (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Restart your shell or source your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for zsh
```

For more installation options, see: [https://pixi.sh/latest/getting_started/installation/](https://pixi.sh/latest/getting_started/installation/)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (development branch)
git clone -b development https://github.com/Naiklab/sns-ext.git
cd sns-ext

# Allocate a bash interactive job for installation step (Please edit the project to match your project account)
bsub -Is -P  <add-project-account> -q premium -n 4 -W 24:00 -R 'rusage[mem=64000]' -R span[hosts=1] bash

# Install all dependencies using pixi
pixi install

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x run generate-settings gather-fastqs
chmod +x routes/*.sh
chmod +x segments/*.sh
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

## Quick Start

1. **Activate pixi environment** (required before running any pipeline commands):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/sns-ext
   eval "$(pixi shell-hook)"
   ```

2. **Generate project settings**:

   ```bash
   ./generate-settings
   ```

3. **Gather FASTQ files**:

   ```bash
   ./gather-fastqs /path/to/fastq/directory
   ```

4. **Run analysis pipeline**:

   ```bash
   ./run [route] [sample-name]
   ```

## Available Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `rna-star` | RNA-seq with STAR alignment |
| `rna-salmon` | RNA-seq with Salmon quantification |
| `rna-rsem` | RNA-seq with RSEM quantification |
| `chip` | ChIP-seq analysis |
| `atac` | ATAC-seq analysis |
| `wgbs` | Whole genome bisulfite sequencing |
| `rrbs` | Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing |
| `wes` | Whole exome sequencing |
| `species` | Species identification and contamination screening |

## Directory Structure

```text
sns-ext/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/           # Main analysis workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ segments/         # Individual processing steps
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/          # Utility and analysis scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run              # Main execution script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate-settings # Project configuration utility
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gather-fastqs    # FASTQ file organization utility
```

## Configuration

The pipeline uses a settings file to configure analysis parameters. Key settings include:

- Reference genome paths
- Tool-specific parameters
- Resource allocation (memory, CPU)
- Output directory structure

## Testing R Package Environment

To verify that all required R packages are properly installed and accessible, use the comprehensive testing script:

```bash

# Allocate a bash interactive job for testing (Please edit the project to match your project account)
bsub -Is -P  <add-project-account> -q premium -n 4 -W 2:00 -R 'rusage[mem=32000]' -R span[hosts=1] bash

# Navigate to your SNS-EXT project directory
cd /path/to/your/sns-ext

# Activate the pixi environment and run the R package test
eval "$(pixi shell-hook)"

Rscript scripts/test-all-r-packages.R
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Test all required R and Bioconductor packages
- üìç Show the installation location of each package using `find.package()`
- üìä Generate a summary report with success/failure status
- üíæ Save detailed results to `r-package-test-results.csv`

**Key packages tested include:**
- **Bioconductor**: DESeq2, DiffBind, ChIPseeker, org.Hs.eg.db, org.Mm.eg.db
- **TxDb packages**: TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene, TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene
- **CRAN packages**: tidyverse, ggplot2, pheatmap, BiocManager

**Installing missing packages:**

If the test reveals missing packages, use the automated installation script:

```bash
# After running the test script above, install missing packages
Rscript scripts/install-missing-r-packages.R

# Verify the installations worked by running the test again
Rscript scripts/test-all-r-packages.R
```

The installation script will:
- üîç Read the test results from `r-package-test-results.csv`
- üì¶ Automatically install all missing packages using BiocManager
- ‚úÖ Verify each installation by testing if the package loads
- üìä Generate an installation report in `r-package-installation-results.csv`
- üí° Provide manual installation suggestions for problematic packages

**Troubleshooting missing packages:**
- Check if packages are listed in `pixi.toml`
- Reinstall pixi environment: `pixi install`
- For packages not available via conda, they can be installed directly in R using BiocManager
- Some packages (like TxDb databases) may need manual installation due to conda availability

## Dependencies

All dependencies are automatically managed by Pixi and include:

- **Pixi package manager** (required - see Prerequisites section)
- **LSF job scheduler** (Minerva HPC)
- **Bioinformatics tools**: STAR, Salmon, MACS2, BWA, Bowtie2, SAMtools, etc.
- **R environment**: R 4.4+ with Bioconductor and CRAN packages
- **Python environment**: Python 3.11+ with data science libraries
- **System tools**: Java, ImageMagick, UCSC utilities
